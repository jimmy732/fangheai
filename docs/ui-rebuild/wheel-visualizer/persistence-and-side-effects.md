# Persistence And Side-Effect Map: wheel visualizer

## Browser Storage

| Key / prefix | Storage | Owner | Data | Read timing | Write / clear trigger | Compatibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none for visualizer | in-memory state | `app.js` | `vehicleFile`, object URL, crop values, job state and result URLs | While dialog is open | Set on open/upload; revoke on close/reset | No migration; personal car photos are not persisted by the storefront |
| `fbox-cart` | `localStorage` | existing cart flow | Product quantities | Existing app startup | Existing add/remove/checkout actions | Frozen; visualizer never changes it |
| `fbox-vehicle` | `localStorage` | existing fitment flow | Year/make/model/trim/drive | Existing app startup | Existing fitment selectors | Frozen; visualizer reads product context only |

## Other Effects

| Functional ID | Effect | Owner | Trigger | Expected behavior | Cleanup / recovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F-001 | Dialog | `app.js` | Open/close button, overlay, Escape | Isolated from existing `state.modal` | Close revokes object URL and clears transient state |
| F-002 | File chooser / drag and drop | browser + `app.js` | Image selection | File stays in memory until generate | Invalid type/size becomes error; reset clears it |
| F-003 | Local object URL | browser | Accepted file | Used only for crop/result mock | `URL.revokeObjectURL` on reset and close |
| F-004 | POST upload/job creation | BoxClaw adapter | Generate on non-localhost or injected adapter | Multipart image + product reference + crop metadata | Server controls auth, job ownership, routing and sponsored usage |
| F-004 | Polling | `wheelVisualizerPoll` | Server returns queued/running | Polls up to 45 attempts, then gives recoverable error | Retry or close stops further UI ownership; server job continues under server policy |
| F-005 | Result rendering | `app.js` | Three successful outputs | Does not alter cart, fitment, product or checkout state | Close releases local asset URL |

## Compatibility Plan For Any Approved Storage Change
